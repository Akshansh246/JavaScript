⚠️Browers have their own callstack, and timed functions are first pushed to the WebAPI then after their time is up they are pushed to the callback queue (📥), and when the callstack is empty the event loop (➿) pushes the first function from the callback queue to the callstack.
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Timeout 1");
    }, 0); 
    console.log("Log 1");
    Output: 
        Log 1
        Timeout 1
